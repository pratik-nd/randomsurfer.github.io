I am presently working as a Data Scientist at Indix.com. I'm part of the <a href="http://www.indix.com/blog/building-comprehensive-database-products-open-problems-challenges-machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning Group</a>. I'm primarily working in building predictive models for product categorization and for automatically extracting important product attributes from product pages and product titles.

Previously, I was Master of Science by Research student at the Department of <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="IIT Madras">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras</a>. I was advised by <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/" target="_blank">Dr. B. Ravindran</a>.
