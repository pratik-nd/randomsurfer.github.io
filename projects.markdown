Role Discovery in Social Networks
---------------------------------
In social network analysis, role discovery involves partitioning the actors in a network into disjoint sets using a notion of equivalence which captures the structure of relationships among actors. The notion of roles differs significantly from that of communities, a popular way to organize actors in a network. A community consists of a set of nodes that have more links among themselves than to other nodes in the network. A role consists of nodes having similar structural signature, such as, broker nodes, clique members, star centers and near isolates. Nodes playing the same role are  typically spread across the network and need not even be in the same component of the network. The focus of my research work has been on the following two projects:

1. M&epsilon;EPs - Soft Role Discovery using Multiple &epsilon;-Equitable Partitions.
2. RID&epsilon;ER - Scalable Role Discovery in Networks.


### Soft Roles

* [M&epsilon;EPs](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw590lpgre5bxiq/meeps.pdf?dl=0) <span>Multiple &epsilon;-Equitable Partitions - Soft Role Discovery for Large Networks</span>
* [Summer School Network Analysis using M&epsilon;EPs](http://randomsurfer.in/summer.html) <span>Qualitative analysis of M&epsilon;EPs on the Summer School Multi-Role Ground Truth Network</span>
* [Key Contributions:] <span>M&epsilon;EPs takes into account the <i>complete structural view of the graph</i> for computing the roles.</span> <br /> <span> Something else? </span>

### Scalable Role Discovery
